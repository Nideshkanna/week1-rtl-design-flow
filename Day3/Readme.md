# 📘 Day 3: Combinational & Sequential Logic Optimizations

In digital design, circuits are broadly categorized into:

- **Combinational Logic** – Output depends only on the current input.
- **Sequential Logic** – Output depends on both input and stored states (flip-flops, latches).

In this section, we focus on **combinational logic optimization** – the process of reducing logic complexity while preserving functionality.

---

## 🔎 Why Optimize Combinational Logic?

- **Area Reduction** → Fewer gates/transistors lead to smaller silicon area.
- **Power Savings** → Less switching activity, reduced leakage and dynamic power.
- **Speed Improvement** → Shorter logic paths, lower propagation delay.

Optimization ensures a more **efficient design**, which is crucial in both **ASIC and FPGA flows**.

---

## ⚡ Techniques of Combinational Optimization

1. **Constant Propagation (Direct Optimization)**
    - Replace logic expressions that involve constants with their simplified form.
    - Example Circuit:
        - A 2-input AND gate `(A·B)` feeds into a NOR gate with input `C`.
        - Expression: `Y = ((A·B) + C)'`
        
        Case: If **A = 0**,
        
        ```
        Y = ((0·B) + C)' 
          = (C)' 
        ```
        
- Original requires **6 transistors** (AND + NOR).
- Optimized requires only **2 transistors** (Inverter).

---

1. **Boolean Logic Optimization**
    - Simplify logic expressions using **K-Maps**, **Quine-McCluskey**, or algebraic methods.
    - Example:

```verilog
assign y = a ? (b ? c : (c ? a : 0)) : (!c);
```

- This can be interpreted as a **nested MUX structure**:
    - If `a=1` → Output depends on `b` and `c`.
    - If `a=0` → Output is `!c`.
- After simplification, the result is:

```verilog
Y = A ⊙ C   (Ex-NOR of A and C)
```

## ✅ Summary of Combinational Optimizations

| Technique | Description | Benefit |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Constant Propagation | Replace expressions with constant inputs | Reduced gate count & power |
| Boolean Logic Reduction | Use K-map / algebraic simplification | Minimal expression, faster logic |
| MUX-Based Simplification | Convert conditional logic into simpler gates | Area & delay savings |

👉 With these techniques, synthesis tools like **Yosys** automatically recognize and apply optimizations, but understanding them at the logic level helps us **predict, debug, and verify** the synthesized circuits.

# 📘 Sequential Logic Optimizations

Unlike combinational logic, **sequential logic circuits** depend on both **inputs and stored states (flops/latches)**. Optimizing sequential logic is more complex since timing, clocking, and state elements must be preserved.

Optimization techniques can be grouped into **basic** and **advanced** methods.

---

## 🔎 Techniques of Sequential Logic Optimization

### 1️⃣ Sequential Constant Propagation (Basic)

- Similar to combinational constant propagation but applied across **flip-flops**.
- If the output of a flop (`Q`) is always constant (either `0` or `1`), the flop can be removed and replaced with a constant driver.

### Example 1: Optimizable Flop

- A flop has `D = 0` (grounded).
- With `Clk` and `Rst` applied:
    - If reset is active → `Q = 0`.
    - If reset is inactive → `Q = 0` (since D is always 0).
- Therefore, **Q is always 0**, independent of clock/reset.
- If `Q` drives a NAND with input `A`, output `Y` will always be `1` (constant).

✅ This flop can be **removed** during optimization.

![03](./images/03.png)

---

### Example 2: Non-Optimizable Flop

- A flop with `D=0`, but now with **Set** connected:
    - If Set is applied → Q = 1 (asynchronous).
    - If Set is not applied → Q depends on clock and remains 0.
- Here, `Q` is **not constant** (changes with Set).
- Cannot simplify as a direct constant because there’s a **clock cycle dependency**.

✅ This flop **must be retained**.

![04](./images/04.png)

---

### 2️⃣ State Optimization

- Sequential machines (FSMs) may have **unused or redundant states**.
- Optimizations include:
    - Removing **unreachable states**.
    - Merging **equivalent states**.
- Saves area and power by reducing the number of flops in the state register.

---

### 3️⃣ Sequential Logic Cloning (Floorplan-Aware Synthesis)

- Applied during **physical-aware synthesis**.
- Suppose flops A, B, C are placed far apart in layout → large routing delay.
- If flop A has **positive slack**, we can duplicate it into two flops:
    - A1 drives B
    - A2 drives C
- Reduces long interconnect delay at the cost of one extra flop.

![05](./images/005.png)

---

### 4️⃣ Retiming

- Redistributes combinational logic across flops to balance path delays.
- Example:
    - One path has **5 ns delay**, another has **2 ns delay**.
    - Maximum clock frequency = limited by slowest path = **200 MHz**.
- Retiming moves some logic so both paths balance to ~3.5 ns each.
- New maximum frequency improves to **250 MHz**.

![06](./images/006.png)

✅ Improves performance without changing functionality.

---

✅ Summary of Sequential Optimizations

| Technique | Description | Benefit |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Sequential Const Prop. | Replace flops with constant outputs if always fixed | Gate & power savings |
| State Optimization | Remove unused/redundant states in FSMs | Fewer flops, simpler FSM |
| Logic Cloning | Duplicate flops for physically distant sinks | Reduces routing delay |
| Retiming | Balance logic delays across flops | Higher performance (fmax ↑) |

👉 With sequential optimizations, synthesis tools achieve **better performance, reduced area, and timing closure** in real-world ASIC/FPGA designs.


# 🧪 Lab: Combinational Logic Optimization

In this lab, we will practically verify **logic optimization techniques** using simple Verilog examples.

![07](./images/07.png)

We will run **Yosys synthesis** with the **Sky130 standard cell library** and observe how redundant logic is simplified.

---

## 1️⃣ Example 1 – `opt_check.v`

### Code:

```verilog
module opt_check (input a , input b , output y);
	assign y = a ? b : 0;
endmodule
```

![08](./images/08.png)

- This is equivalent to a **2x1 Mux** where:
    
    **y=a?b:0 ==> (!a⋅0)+(a⋅b) ==> a⋅b**
      
- So, the expected optimized circuit is a **2-input AND gate**.


![09](./images/09.png)

---

## 2️⃣ Example 2 – `opt_check2.v`

### Code:

```verilog
module opt_check2 (input a , input b , output y);
	assign y = a ? 1 : b;
endmodule
```

![10](./images/10.png)

- Expression:
    
    **y = (!a⋅b)+(a⋅1) ==> a+b**
    
- Optimized result is a **2-input OR gate**.

👉 This process of simplifying Boolean expressions is known as **Boolean Algebra Optimization** (or **Algebraic Simplification**).

![11](./images/11.png)

---

## 3️⃣ Example 3 – `opt_check3.v`

### Code:

```
module opt_check3 (input a , input b, input c , output y);
	assign y = a ? (c ? b : 0) : 0;
endmodule
```

![12](./images/12.png)

- Expansion:
    
    **y = (!a⋅0)+a(!c⋅0+c⋅b) = a⋅b⋅c**
    
- Expected optimized result is a **3-input AND gate**.

![13](./images/13.png)

---

## 4️⃣ Example 4 – `opt_check4.v`

### Code:

```verilog
module opt_check4 (input a , input b , input c , output y);
	assign y = a ? (b ? (a & c) : c) : (!c);
endmodule
```

- After simplification, this reduces to:
    
    **y = a⊙c (XNOR operation between a and c)**
    

![14](./images/14.png)

---

## 5️⃣ Example 5 – `multiple_module_opt.v`

### Code:

```verilog
module sub_module1(input a , input b , output y);
 assign y = a & b;
endmodule

module sub_module2(input a , input b , output y);
 assign y = a ^ b;
endmodule

module multiple_module_opt(input a , input b , input c , input d , output y);
wire n1,n2,n3;

sub_module1 U1 (.a(a) , .b(1'b1) , .y(n1));
sub_module2 U2 (.a(n1), .b(1'b0) , .y(n2));
sub_module2 U3 (.a(b), .b(d) , .y(n3));

assign y = c | (b & n1); 
endmodule
```
![15](./images/15.png)

### Observations:

1. `sub_module1` → `y = a & 1 = a`
2. `sub_module2` with `b = 0` → reduces to just `a`
3. Some submodules become redundant.

### Yosys Commands Used:

```verilog
read_liberty -lib ../my_lib/lib/sky130_fd_sc_hd__tt_025C_1v80.lib 
read_verilog multiple_module_opt.v 
synth -top multiple_module_opt 
flatten
opt_clean -purge
abc -liberty ../my_lib/lib/sky130_fd_sc_hd__tt_025C_1v80.lib
show
```

### 🔹 Special Commands Explained

- **`flatten`** → Flattens design hierarchy by replacing module instances with their logic. This exposes optimization opportunities across module boundaries.
- **`opt_clean -purge`** → Removes unused cells, wires, and redundant logic.
- **`abc`** → Performs **technology mapping** and further Boolean optimization using the given `.lib`.

![16](./images/16.png)

## ✅ Summary of Lab

| File | Initial Description | Optimized Result |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `opt_check.v` | Mux (a?b:0) | AND gate (a&b) |
| `opt_check2.v` | Mux (a?1:b) | OR gate (a+b) |
| `opt_check3.v` | Nested mux (a?(c?b:0):0) | 3-input AND (a·b·c) |
| `opt_check4.v` | Complex mux nesting | XNOR (a ⊙ c) |
| `multiple_module_opt.v` | Hierarchical with redundant submodules | Flattened + reduced to simple logic |

👉 With these labs, we’ve seen how **Boolean simplification, flattening, and clean-up passes** in Yosys lead to **smaller, faster, and more power-efficient** combinational circuits.

# **Sequential Optimization Techniques – Lab**

In this lab, we explore how sequential elements (flip-flops) behave under synthesis when their inputs are constants or simple dependencies. Unlike combinational logic, flip-flops cannot always be optimized away because their operation depends on the **clock edge** and sometimes on **asynchronous reset/set behavior**.

We use the following files for this exercise:

```
$ ls *dff_const*
dff_const1.v  dff_const3.v  dff_const5.v     tb_dff_const2.v  tb_dff_const4.v
dff_const2.v  dff_const4.v  tb_dff_const1.v  tb_dff_const3.v  tb_dff_const5.v
```

![17](./images/17.png)

## **Example 1 – Constant D Flip-Flop**

File: `dff_const1.v`

```
module dff_const1(input clk, input reset, output reg q);
always @(posedge clk, posedge reset)
begin
	if(reset)
		q <= 1'b0;
	else
		q <= 1'b1;
end
endmodule
```

**Analysis**

- At reset → `q = 0`.
- Else → `q = 1`, but only on the **next clock edge**.
- One might think this reduces to `q = ~reset`, but that’s **not correct**, because of the **clocked nature**.
- The synthesized design **still contains a flip-flop**.

**Simulation Commands**

```verilog
iverilog dff_const1.v tb_dff_const1.v
./a.out
gtkwave tb_dff_const1.vcd
```

![18](./images/18.png)

**GTKWave (Simulation):**

- At reset → `q=0`.
- After reset deassertion → `q` only goes high **on next rising edge of clk**.
- Confirms this is **not just combinational ~reset**.

**Synthesis Commands**

```verilog
read_liberty -lib ../my_lib/lib/sky130_fd_sc_hd__tt_025C_1v80.lib 
read_verilog dff_const1.v 
synth -top dff_const1 
dfflibmap -liberty ../my_lib/lib/sky130_fd_sc_hd__tt_025C_1v80.lib 
abc -liberty ../my_lib/lib/sky130_fd_sc_hd__tt_025C_1v80.lib
show
```

![19](./images/19.png)

- Shows a single **DFF cell** with reset pin.
- Confirms that synthesis **retains the flop**.

## **Example 2 – Set Flip-Flop**

File: `dff_const2.v`

```
module dff_const2(input clk, input reset, output reg q);
always @(posedge clk, posedge reset)
begin
	if(reset)
		q <= 1'b1;
	else
		q <= 1'b1;
end
endmodule
```

**Analysis**

- Regardless of `clk`, `q = 1`.
- Here reset acts as a **set pin**.
- Optimized design is just a constant driver to `q`.

**Simulation & Synthesis**

```
iverilog dff_const2.v tb_dff_const2.v
./a.out
gtkwave tb_dff_const2.vcd
```

**GTKWave:**

![20](./images/20.png)


- Regardless of clk or reset, `q=1` permanently.
- Simulation confirms no toggling.

**Yosys Schematic:**

![21](./images/21.png)

- Simplified to a **constant driver (1’b1)**.
- **No flop cell** in the netlist.

---

## **Example 3 – Two Flops in Series**

File: `dff_const3.v`

```verilog
module dff_const3(input clk, input reset, output reg q);
reg q1;

always @(posedge clk, posedge reset)
begin
	if(reset)
	begin
		q <= 1'b1;
		q1 <= 1'b0;
	end
	else
	begin
		q1 <= 1'b1;
		q <= q1;
	end
end
endmodule
```

**Analysis**

- Two flip-flops share `clk` and `reset`.
- At reset: `q=1`, `q1=0`.
- On clock edge: `q1 → 1`, `q → q1`.
- `q` samples `q1` with **one cycle latency**.
- Result: `q` ≠ constant → **cannot be optimized away**.

**GTKWave:**

![22](./images/22.png)

- Reset: `q=1`, `q1=0`.
- On first clk edge after reset: `q1→1`, `q→0`.
- On second clk edge: `q→1`.
- Shows **one cycle delay** between `q1` and `q`.

**Yosys Schematic:**

![23](./images/23.png)

- One flop mapped as **reset flop**.
- Second flop mapped as **set flop**.
- Inverter added internally for control signals.
- Two flip-flops visible.
- One mapped to reset flop, another to set flop.
- Matches GTKWave timing (q1 → q delay).

## **Example 4 – Constant Registers**

File: `dff_const4.v`

```
module dff_const4(input clk, input reset, output reg q);
reg q1;

always @(posedge clk, posedge reset)
begin
	if(reset)
	begin
		q <= 1'b1;
		q1 <= 1'b1;
	end
	else
	begin
		q1 <= 1'b1;
		q <= q1;
	end
end
endmodule
```

**Analysis**

- Both `q` and `q1` tied to constant `1`.
- During synthesis: **no flops inferred**.


**GTKWave:**

![24](./images/24.png)

- `q` and `q1` always 1 after reset.
- Behaves like constants.

**Yosys Report**

```
=== dff_const4 ===
   Number of cells: 0
```

![25](./images/25.png)

**Yosys Schematic:**

- Optimized completely to constants.
- **No flop cells** in final netlist.

---

## **Example 5 – Reset + Latched Constant**

File: `dff_const5.v`

```verilog
module dff_const5(input clk, input reset, output reg q);
reg q1;

always @(posedge clk, posedge reset)
begin
	if(reset)
	begin
		q <= 1'b0;
		q1 <= 1'b0;
	end
	else
	begin
		q1 <= 1'b1;
		q <= q1;
	end
end
endmodule
```

**Analysis**

- On reset: both `q` and `q1 = 0`.
- On next clock: `q1 → 1`, `q → q1`.
- Effectively a **2-stage DFF chain** with initial reset.
- **Cannot optimize** due to dependency.

**GTKWave:**

![26](./images/26.png)

- Reset: `q=0`, `q1=0`.
- Next clk: `q1=1`, `q=0`.
- Next clk: `q=1`.
- Again a **one cycle delay** visible.

**Synthesis Log**

```verilog
=== dff_const5 ===
   Number of cells: 2
   $_DFF_PP0_  2
```

**Yosys Schematic:**

![27](./images/27.png)

- Two flops mapped (`sky130_fd_sc_hd__dfrtp_1`).
- Matches the sequential behavior in GTKWave.

---

## **Key Special Yosys Commands**

1. **`dfflibmap`**
    - Maps generic flip-flops (`$_DFF_*`) to actual standard cell DFFs from the technology library.
2. **`abc`**
    - Performs sequential & combinational logic optimization, considering timing constraints of the library.
3. **`show`**
    - Generates schematic to visually verify the optimized netlist.

---

✅ **Summary**

- Sequential optimization differs from combinational since flops are edge-sensitive.
- Constant inputs don’t always eliminate flops.
- Some designs reduce to constants (`dff_const2`, `dff_const4`).
- Others must retain flops due to timing dependencies (`dff_const1`, `dff_const3`, `dff_const5`).

# **🛠️ Unused Outputs Optimization Technique**

In this section, we explore **Unused Outputs Optimization** and understand how synthesis tools remove unnecessary logic to reduce area, power, and improve efficiency.

---

## **🔹 Unused Outputs Optimization Lab**

We will use the following Verilog files:

```
counter_opt.v
counter_opt2.v

```

---

### **Example 1 – counter_opt.v**

**Code Overview:**

```verilog
module counter_opt (input clk , input reset , output q);
reg [2:0] count;
assign q = count[0];

always @(posedge clk ,posedge reset)
begin
	if(reset)
		count <= 3'b000;
	else
		count <= count + 1;
end
endmodule

```

**Analysis:**

- 3-bit internal counter: `count[2:0]`
- Primary output `q` only connected to **LSB `count[0]`**.
- **Unused bits** `count[1]` and `count[2]` do not influence any output.

**Behavior:**

- Counter increments 0 → 7, rolls back to 0.
- Only `count[0]` toggles output every clock cycle.
- Other bits are unnecessary for this output.

**Synthesis in Yosys:**

```bash
read_liberty -lib ../my_lib/lib/sky130_fd_sc_hd__tt_025C_1v80.lib
read_verilog counter_opt.v
synth -top counter_opt
dfflibmap -liberty ../my_lib/lib/sky130_fd_sc_hd__tt_025C_1v80.lib
abc -liberty ../my_lib/lib/sky130_fd_sc_hd__tt_025C_1v80.lib
show
```

![28](./images/28.png)

**Observation:**

- ✅ Only **one DFF** is retained for `count[0]` (reset flop).
- `count[1]` and `count[2]` are removed.
- An **inverter** connected to `count[0]` forms a **toggle DFF**, acting as a 1-bit counter.

![29](./images/29.png)


**Special Yosys Commands Used:**

- `dfflibmap`: Maps DFFs to technology library cells.
- `abc`: Performs logic optimization including removing unused outputs.
- `show`: Visualizes the synthesized netlist.

---

### **Example 2 – counter_opt2.v**

**Code Overview:**

```verilog
module counter_opt (input clk , input reset , output q);
reg [2:0] count;
assign q = (count[2:0] == 3'b100);

always @(posedge clk ,posedge reset)
begin
	if(reset)
		count <= 3'b000;
	else
		count <= count + 1;
end
endmodule

```

**Analysis:**

- All **3 bits of the counter** are used to generate the output `q`.
- Output is high only when `count` equals 3’b100.

**Synthesis in Yosys:**

```bash
read_liberty -lib ../my_lib/lib/sky130_fd_sc_hd__tt_025C_1v80.lib
read_verilog counter_opt2.v
synth -top counter_opt
dfflibmap -liberty ../my_lib/lib/sky130_fd_sc_hd__tt_025C_1v80.lib
abc -liberty ../my_lib/lib/sky130_fd_sc_hd__tt_025C_1v80.lib
show
```

![30](./images/30.png)

**Observation:**

- ✅ All **3 DFFs** are retained.
- Output `q` generated by a **3-input NOR gate**:
    
    ```
    q = count[2] & ~count[1] & ~count[0]
    
    ```
    
- All bits contribute to the logic; no bits are optimized away.

![31](./images/31.png)

---

### **💡 Key Takeaways**

1. **Unused Output Optimization**:
    - Removes logic that does not affect primary outputs.
    - Reduces unnecessary DFFs and combinational logic.
2. **Behavioral Impact**:
    - Logic connected to unused intermediate signals is completely removed.
    - Optimized netlist retains only logic that **affects primary outputs**.
3. **Yosys Commands for Optimization**:
    - `synth` → Synthesizes the top-level design.
    - `dfflibmap` → Maps flip-flops to technology cells.
    - `abc` → Optimizes logic including removing unused outputs.
    - `show` → Visual schematic display.
4. **Practical Importance**:
    - Reduces area, power consumption, and complexity.
    - Ensures that only the **required storage and combinational logic** are implemented in silicon.

---

### **📌 Counter Summary Table**

| Design File | DFFs Retained | Logic Optimized | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| counter_opt.v | 1 | count[1,2] | Only LSB used → others removed |
| counter_opt2.v | 3 | None | All bits used → no optimization |
